            <p>Hello guys!</p>
            <p>My name <strong>Adji Saputra</strong>, you can called me Adji. I was born in the year 2004, exactly on July 16, in Bogor. I was a student in one of the vocational schools leading in bogor <strong>SMK-SMAK Bogor</strong>. Currently I'm studying in year 2.</p><br>
            <p>here I will tell you my experience during distance learning. Distance learning during this pandemic gives me a lot of lesson how can I pass through this state. On the first day of school online, I was exhausted in the study. But as time went on I found various methods of learning that I am more passion in learning. One of the methods of my study is to provide an appreciation of my own self, for example if I have finished working on this task then I can play the game or maybe go and play with my friends. It is very effective to provide increased enthusiasm for learning.</p><br>
            <p>and here I will show you some photos of me and my friends while on vacation</p>
